        📖 History of Ccwei
        Founded in 2018, Ccwei began as a small creative studio driven by a passion for storytelling and beautiful design. The name Ccwei symbolizes connection — between readers and writers, imagination and reality.
        Starting with a handful of independent titles, Ccwei quickly gained recognition for its visually striking covers and heartfelt narratives that blend modern emotion with artistic expression. The company’s motto, “Read,Relax and Escape,” reflects its belief that stories have the power to heal, inspire, and connect people across cultures.
        By 2022, Ccwei expanded into digital publishing, bringing East Asian-inspired fiction, poetry, and art books to a global audience. Its signature glowing-book logo came to represent creativity, sincerity, and the light that stories bring into people’s lives.
        Today, Ccwei continues to champion emerging voices and timeless tales, striving to create books that are not only read — but felt.
